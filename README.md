# eSpeak NG playback library

[![Build Status](https://github.com/eeejay/espeaker/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eeejay/espeaker/actions)

This library provides a `rodio::Source` that can be used to generate eSpeak audio. It supports listing and setting voices, triggering a callback for boundary or marker events, and full control of other eSpeak parameters like rate and pitch. See example and tests for usage.
